    " I arrived at the event just as it was starting and immediately checked out the CSP section. After that, I explored different booths such as the Northrop Grumman booth, inventors club, and the stock market game. I was there from around 5:00 PM and spent about 45 mins exploring everything. I was really inspired by the stock market game and plan to join it soon. I also hope to work on a computer science project next year that I can present like this."
