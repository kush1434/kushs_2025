    "I did really well on the MCQ and am proud of myself. I worked together with my peers to understand the tougher questions, and their help corrected a mistake I made in binary. This boosted my confidence for the AP test, especially in reasonable time and binary search algorithms. The topics I need to improve are binary search and random values. In all I scored a 52/67 on the exam.\n",
