    "This year in CSP has been a great learning experience. At the start, I had limited coding knowledge, but now I feel much more confident building projects. I’ve improved a lot in understanding how to design solutions using code. Overall, this class helped me grow not just technically, but also in how I approach challenges logically and creatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe my greatest achievment was my work on Legendary Motorsports. It brought together everything I learned in CSP and pushed me to go beyond. Working with a team of six using the AGILE methodology taught me how to collaborate effectively and manage tasks in a real development cycle. I contributed to building a full-stack Flask web app, integrating real-time car data and a user favorites system with full CRUD functionality. Setting up user authentication and deploying the site with AWS EC2 and Nginx showed me what it takes to bring a project from idea to reality. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that showed how far I’ve come this year."

This enabled our team to meet the deadline with a fully functional live site."

It took me more time to solve problems dealing with algorithms and different data types. Towards the end of the year, while working on a lesson for Mr. Mort, my commits required a lot of testing before I sent them through to the repository. Additionally, while learning the new concept of web sockets, it took more time reading documentation, watching videos, and understanding diagrams rather than actual programming. "
